make_change.cpp

Computes the minimum number of coins (of given denominations) required to make a given total and the optimal set of coins required.

It is assumed that a 1 pence coin is available, otherwise the problem may have no solution.

INPUTS:

coins = a list of coin denominations in any order (1 pence can be included but it is assumed anyway)
numcoins = the length of the coins array
total = the total to be made
